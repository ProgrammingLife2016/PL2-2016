# Feedback PL2 Pantzerfaust

Sorry for the late feedback, there was some confusion as to how to and when to send the rubrics to you guys. Below you will find the rubrics for sprint 1.

Note: The rubrics for Code Evolution Quality will not count this time. 

There are some low grades, which I can explain briefly here. You do need better code readability: Some classes have no comments, just gigantic laps of code and unconventional naming. I see that Travis CI is not building and there has been close to none testing. You've set up the tooling correctly, but you also need to correct the alerts it gives. 

Comments on the Architecture Design document will be there Monday.

If you have any questions, please ask them tonight, as I will be away until Monday.
