## Notes
Sprint
Definition: 8

- By this stage testing should not be in the sprint plan anymore
- Keep it formal ("because sleeping morethan a few hours per week is notappreciated by Thomas", "somehow")

Splitting: 10

- Guessing the hours Wouter has is because he was ill?

Responsibility: 10

Reflection
Overall: check spelling
Estimation:5

Prioritisation: 9

- After the presentation priorities have shifted towards semantic zooming (good)

Reflection: 8

- @aggregate integration, this is not impossible, elaborate on why you decided not to switch to another tool
- Lots of notes that could be elaborated on (resulting in more 'main problems')
