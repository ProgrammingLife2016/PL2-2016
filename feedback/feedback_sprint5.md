## Notes
Sprint
Definition: 10

Splitting: 10

Responsibility: 10

Reflection
Reflection: 8
-The "adjustment for next sprint plan" is actually a reaction to Wouters illness.
-Some notes don't explain much (e.g. problem 1 and 2 combined to this not being finished)

Estimation: 7

Priority: 6
-Tasks both done partly while they had different priorities. Priorities should also be followed up.
-I recall that in the customer meeting was stressed on the usability; I don't see that in your tasks. 

Architecture
Changes: 5
Document: 5
-No new version, same feedback as last week
-Feedback should be implemented

CQ: 9
-Unused classes should be deleted

Readability
Formatting: 10
Naming: 10
Commenting: 8
-Some classes not commented

CI
Building: 10
Testing: 10

Tooling: 5
-Still loads of tooling errors
-Should be fixed per PR

PBD
Branching: 10
Code Review: 10


## Announcements
