## Notes
sprint:
-Splitting: Should be way more hours

reflection: 
-Prioritization: Lots of 3s for tasks where I think should be higher
-'Let people do the tasks which their tasks depend onthemselves.' really a good solution?
-Reflection: good analysis but present a better solution (why won't this happen again in the future?)

EAD:
-No new version
-Should implement previous feedback
-Changes still mapped to an outdated EAD

Readability:
-Spotted some outdated comments

Tooling:
-PMD, CPD errors
Testing:
-Nice coverage, should be able to build myself
